### Customized Scans

#### Example: Add comments to Jira
Scan Jira for any instances of a secret leak on a ticket, and when one is detected, append a comment to the ticket, recommending that the participants utilize 1Password and contact security@yourcompany.com if they require assistance.
```yaml
name: jira_secret_scanning
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 10 *  *  *"
  workflow_dispatch:
    
jobs:
  jira_secret_scanning:
    name: Jira Scanning for Secret Leaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Run n0s1 secret scanner on Jira
        uses: spark1security/n0s1-action@main
        env:
          JIRA_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
        with:
          scan-target: 'jira_scan'
          user-email: 'service_account@<YOUR_COMPANY>.atlassian.net'
          platform-url: 'https://<YOUR_COMPANY>.atlassian.net'
          post-comment: True
          secret-manager: '1Password'
          contact-help: 'security@yourcompany.com'
```

#### Example: Scan Jira an upload results GitHub Codescanning
Scan Jira for any instances of a secret leak, and submit the findings to [GitHub Security Codescanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/about-the-tool-status-page#viewing-the-tool-status-page-for-a-repository).
```yaml
name: jira_secret_scanning
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 10 *  *  *"
  workflow_dispatch:
    
jobs:
  jira_secret_scanning:
    name: Jira Scanning for Secret Leaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Run n0s1 secret scanner on Jira
        uses: spark1security/n0s1-action@main
        env:
          JIRA_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
        with:
          scan-target: 'jira_scan'
          user-email: 'service_account@<YOUR_COMPANY>.atlassian.net'
          platform-url: 'https://<YOUR_COMPANY>.atlassian.net'
          report-file: 'jira_leaked_secrets.sarif'
          report-format: 'sarif'
      - name: Upload n0s1 secret scan results to GitHub Security Codescanning
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: jira_leaked_secrets.sarif
```

#### Example: Scan Jira an upload results to workflow artifact
Scan Jira for any instances of a secret leak, and save the report file to "n0s1-artifact".
```yaml
name: jira_secret_scanning
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 10 *  *  *"
  workflow_dispatch:
    
jobs:
  jira_secret_scanning:
    name: Jira Scanning for Secret Leaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Run n0s1 secret scanner on Jira
        uses: spark1security/n0s1-action@main
        env:
          JIRA_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
        with:
          scan-target: 'jira_scan'
          user-email: 'service_account@<YOUR_COMPANY>.atlassian.net'
          platform-url: 'https://<YOUR_COMPANY>.atlassian.net'
          report-file: 'jira_leaked_secrets.json'
      - name: Upload n0s1 secret scan report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: n0s1-artifact
          path: jira_leaked_secrets.json
          retention-days: 5
```

#### Example: Debug Linear.app findings
Scan Linear.app for potential secret leaks and present the results in the GitHub Action logs. Please exercise caution, as including leaked secrets in the logs could exacerbate the issue by exposing the secrets to anyone with authorization to access the GitHub Action logs. Consider utilizing the 'show-matched-secret-on-logs' flag exclusively for debugging purposes. 
```yaml
name: linear_secret_scanning
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 11 *  *  *"
  workflow_dispatch:
    
jobs:
  linear_secret_scanning:
    name: Linear.app Scanning for Secret Leaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Run n0s1 secret scanner on Linear
        uses: spark1security/n0s1-action@main
        env:
          LINEAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LINEAR_API_KEY }}
        with:
          scan-target: 'linear_scan'
          show-matched-secret-on-logs: True
```
